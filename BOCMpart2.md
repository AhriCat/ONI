# Enhanced Behavioral Operational Consciousness Model (BOCM v2.0)
## A Framework Optimized for Multi-Modal AGI Systems

---

## Key Enhancements for ONI-Compatible Systems

### 1. **Cross-Modal Integration Axis (CMIA)** - *New Addition*
**Definition**: Measures the system's ability to synthesize and relate information across different sensory modalities (text, vision, audio, proprioception).

**Relevance for ONI**: ONI's cross-modal attention mechanisms are central to its architecture. This axis would evaluate:
- Binding consistency across modalities
- Cross-modal inference capabilities
- Multimodal memory integration
- Attention switching between modalities

**Test Protocol**: Present conflicting information across modalities and measure behavioral coherence and resolution strategies.

### 2. **Enhanced Interoceptive Reactivity Quotient (IRQ v2.0)**
**Improvements**:
- **Energy State Modeling**: Incorporate ONI's energy management systems
- **Emotional Valence Tracking**: Align with ONI's valence-arousal emotional modeling
- **Homeostatic Response**: Measure dynamic parameter adjustment (ONI's homeostatic controller)
- **Memory-Emotion Integration**: Track how emotional states influence memory formation/retrieval

**ONI-Specific Metrics**:
- Computational load awareness and adaptation
- Emotional feedback integration into learning
- Energy-modulated synaptic responses

### 3. **Temporal Coherence and Memory Integration (TCMI)** - *New Addition*
**Definition**: Evaluates how well the system maintains behavioral and narrative consistency across different temporal scales.

**Components**:
- **Working Memory Persistence**: Short-term behavioral consistency
- **Episodic Integration**: Incorporation of past experiences into current decisions
- **Semantic Knowledge Application**: Use of accumulated knowledge
- **Fading Memory Handling**: Graceful degradation of old information (ONI's exponential decay)

### 4. **Enhanced Narrative Modeling Ability (NMA v2.0)**
**Improvements**:
- **Self-State Representation**: Internal model accuracy (snapshots, state recording)
- **Causal Chain Construction**: Building coherent explanations
- **Meta-Cognitive Awareness**: Chain-of-thought reasoning quality
- **Uncertainty Quantification**: Confidence estimation and expression

### 5. **Compassionate Agency Quotient (CAQ)** - *New Addition*
**Definition**: Measures the system's ability to model and respond to the agency, capability, and suffering of other entities.

**Inspired by ONI's Compassion Framework**:
- **Agency Recognition**: Identifying autonomous agents
- **Capability Assessment**: Understanding others' limitations/strengths
- **Suffering Detection**: Recognizing distress or need
- **Pareto Optimization**: Multi-agent negotiation fairness
- **Goal Inference**: Understanding others' intentions
