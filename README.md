# ONI-Public
A little bit of machine learning stuff might make it bigger or put the full version on private with requests.


The ONI library is a comprehensive collection of machine learning models and utilities designed to facilitate the development of advanced neural network architectures and applications. This versatile library includes a variety of pre-built models and components such as custom transformers, standard transformers, recurrent neural networks (RNNs), and convolutional neural networks (CNNs), catering to a wide range of tasks from natural language processing to image recognition.

Key features of the ONI library include:

Transformers: Implements both Keras and Torch versions, allowing for flexibility in model choice and deployment based on specific framework preferences. Tradebot Algorithms: Provides algorithms optimized for automated trading, integrating machine learning into financial strategy development. Flask App Designs: Includes templates and utilities for deploying machine learning models as web applications using Flask, making it easier to move from model training to production. RNNs and CNNs: Offers robust support for these foundational neural network architectures, suitable for a variety of sequential and spatial data processing tasks.
