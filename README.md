# Oni

Oni is a modular, multi-modal AGI (Artificial General Intelligence) system designed for fast learning, decision making, and interaction with multiple environments (text, image, audio). Oni integrates a transformer-based NLP core, Vision Transformer, and diffusion models to form an intelligent, adaptable system.

## Features

- **Modular Architecture**: Oni can be extended or optimized by adding or modifying individual modules.
- **Multi-modal Learning**: Supports NLP, Vision, and Audio inputs.
- **Homeostatic Controller**: Adjusts internal parameters dynamically to maintain system stability.
- **Neural Networks**: Utilizes advanced transformer-based architectures.
- **Fast and Efficient**: Designed for quick decision-making and real-time interactions.

## Installation

To install Oni, clone the repository and install the dependencies:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/ahricat/oni.git
cd oni
pip install -r requirements.txt
