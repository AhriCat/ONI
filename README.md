# Oni

Oni is a **modular, multi-modal AGI (Artificial General Intelligence) system** designed for **creativity, reasoning, and interaction across multiple environments and modalities** (text, image, audio, animation, and more). Powered by cutting-edge architectures, including **transformer-based models, latent diffusion models**, and advanced reasoning modules, Oni is a **next-generation intelligence system** for real-world applications.

Oni is **decentralized at its core**, with plans to operate on a custom blockchain to enable **global participation** in compute, training, and reinforcement learning, creating a truly open-source AI ecosystem **for the people, by the people**.
