# üß† ONI Architecture Overview

**ONI** (Omni-Neural Intelligence) is a large-scale, modular AGI framework designed for reasoning, perception, agency, and self-regulation. Unlike the compact OniMini, the full ONI system incorporates persistent learning, dynamic tool injection, multi-agent scheduling, executive control, and advanced ethical frameworks to serve as a lifelong generalist intelligence.
